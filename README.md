OMR EVALUATION PROJECT
The OMR Evaluation System automates the process of grading multiple-choice answer sheets.
It uses image processing techniques to detect marked bubbles on scanned OMR sheets.
The system compares detected answers with a pre-defined answer key.
It calculates scores accurately and instantly, reducing human error.
The project supports batch processing of multiple sheets at once.
It includes data validation to detect incomplete or incorrectly marked sheets.
The user interface allows uploading, reviewing, and exporting results.
Technologies used include Python, OpenCV, and possibly machine learning.
This system is suitable for academic exams, surveys, and assessments.
It enhances efficiency, reliability, and transparency in result processing.
